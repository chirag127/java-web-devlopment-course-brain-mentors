## How to Use

### Q1: Calculator

To run the calculator program, navigate to the `exercises/23-02-21/1` directory and compile the `Calc.java` file using the `javac` command:

```java
$ javac Calc.java
```

Then, run the program using the `java` command, passing the arithmetic expression as command-line arguments. For example, to compute the expression `10 + 2`, you would run the following command:

```java
$ java Calc 10 + 2
```

This would output the result: `Result is : 12`.

### Q2: Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter

To run the Celsius to Fahrenheit converter program, navigate to the `exercises/23-02-21/2` directory and compile the `CelsiusToFahrenheit.java` file using the `javac` command:

```java
$ javac CelsiusToFahrenheit.java
```

Then, run the program using the `java` command, passing the temperature in Celsius as a command-line argument. For example, to convert a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit, you would run the following command:

```java
$ java CelsiusToFahrenheit 30
```

This would output the result: `Temperature in Fahrenheit is: 86.0`.

### Q3: Days to Years, Weeks, and Days Converter

To run the days to years, weeks, and days converter program, navigate to the `exercises/23-02-21/3` directory and compile the `DaysToYearsWeeksDays.java` file using the `javac` command:

```java
$ javac DaysToYearsWeeksDays.java
```

Then, run the program using the `java` command, passing the number of days as a command-line argument. For example, to convert 400 days to years, weeks, and days, you would run the following command:

```java
$ java DaysToYearsWeeksDays 400
```

This would output the result: `400 days = 1 year(s), 1 week(s), and 3 day(s)`.

### Q4: Age Calculator

To run the age calculator program, navigate to the `exercises/23-02-21/4` directory and compile the `AgeCalculator.java` file using the `javac` command:

```java
$ javac AgeCalculator.java
```

Then, run the program using the `java` command, passing the date of birth in the format `MM/dd/yyyy` as a command-line argument. For example, to calculate the age of someone born on June 12, 1990, you would run the following command:

```java
$ java AgeCalculator 06/12/1990
```

This would output the person's age in years.

### Q5: Username Formatter

To run the username formatter program, navigate to the `exercises/23-02-21/5` directory and compile the `UsernameFormatter.java` file using the `javac` command:

```java
$ javac UsernameFormatter.java
```

Then, run the program using the `java` command, passing the username as a command-line argument. For example, to format the username "rAm KUmar shARma", you would run the following command:

```java
$ java UsernameFormatter rAm KUmar shARma
```

This would output the formatted username: `Ram Kumar Sharma`.
